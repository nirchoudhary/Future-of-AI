        <h2>Section 1: Introduction to Prediction & Analysis</h2>
        <p id="section1-content">
            Prediction and analysis are crucial components in the realm of data science and analytics. They involve various techniques and tools to forecast future trends based on historical data. Understanding these concepts is essential for making informed decisions in numerous fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing.
        </p>
        <h3>What is Prediction?</h3>
        <p>
            Prediction refers to the process of using historical data to determine the likelihood of a future event. This can involve statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and more.
        </p>
        <h3>What is Analysis?</h3>
        <p>
            Analysis involves examining data to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights. It can be descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, or prescriptive.
        </p>
        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Predicting stock prices, risk management.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Forecasting disease outbreaks, personalized medicine.</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Customer behavior analysis, sales forecasting.</li>
